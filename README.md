## Features

Stonks is a collection of helpful tools to make stock searches and algotrading easier. The goal is
for stonks to be everything but the backtesting. With stonks you can:

- Buy and sell on Robinhood with node
- Custom finviz screener
- Diverse scrapers, pulling symbols from Robinhood, finviz, and Dividend Value Builder

## Installation

```bash
npm install stonksjs
```

or

```bash
yarn add stonksjs
```

## Usage

Import the module in your script or project, and execute one of the functions available:

```js
const stonks = require('stonksjs');

// stonks is a plan object, with each submodule containing the functions
const { screeners, robinhood, scrapers } = stonks;

// all functions are promise based
const symbols = await screeners.swingTrendingUp();

// trade on Robinhood by saving your credentials as environment variables
const order = await robinhood.buy('MSFT', {
  qty: 100,
  type: 'limit',
  price: 123.45,
});
```

More examples and API docs can be found in [`docs/api`](docs/api).

### Environment Variables

In order to use stonks you must have your Robinhood credentials stored in a `.env` file - even if
you're not using any Robinhood functions, an error will be thrown if they aren't set (I'm currently
working on fixing this: [#10](https://github.com/nielse63/stonksjs/issues/19)).

For instructions on how to get the device token value,
[read this GitHub comment](https://github.com/robinhood-unofficial/pyrh/issues/176#issuecomment-487310801).
Add the following to your `.env` file:

```
ROBINHOOD_USERNAME='xxxxxxxxx'
ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD='xxxxxxxxx'
ROBINHOOD_DEVICE_TOKEN='xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

See [`.env.sample`](.env.sample) for all the environment variables that should be defined.

## API

Full API docs and examples can be found in [`docs/api`](docs/api).
