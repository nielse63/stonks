## Features

- Custom screeners from finviz, msn, and finscreener
- Detailed ticker fundamentals
- Module and CommonJS compatible
- Light-weight - few to no dependencies

### Goals

**What stonksjs is:**

The primary objective of this project are:

- To provide a collection of reliable algotrading utilities written in
  typescript/node
- Take some of the guess-work out of the stock research process by using
  industry-tested, predefined screeners
- Provide more data-points for a given instrument than most packages currently
  available
- Enable algotrading programmers with diversified assets - not just the hottest
  options rumors on [r/wallstreetbets](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets)

**What stonksjs is not:**

- stonksjs **is not** a roboadvisor or professional trading app - this is just a
  fun little side project
- stonksjs **is not** an unofficial API for Robinhood or any other brokerage. If
  that's what you're looking for, I'd recommend
  [algotrader](https://github.com/torreyleonard/algotrader)
- stonksjs **is not** a backtesting tool, although that might get added to the
  roadmap soon

## Development

### Setup

#### Prerequisites

This project requires node `v16.20.1`.

#### Installation

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone http://github.com/nielse63/stonksjs.git
cd stonksjs
nvm use
npm ci
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test

# run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```
