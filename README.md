## Features

Stonks is a collection of helpful tools to make stock searches and algotrading easier. The goal is
for stonks to be everything but the backtesting. With stonks you can:

- Buy and sell on Robinhood with node
- Custom finviz screener
- Diverse scrapers, pulling symbols from Robinhood, finviz, and Dividend Value Builder

## Installation

```bash
npm install stonksjs
```

or

```bash
yarn add stonksjs
```

## Usage

Import the module in your script or project, and execute one of the functions available:

```js
const stonks = require('stonksjs');

// stonks is a plan object, with each submodule containing the functions
const { screeners, scrapers } = stonks;

// all functions are promise based
const symbols = await screeners.swingTrendingUp();

// trade on Robinhood by saving your credentials as environment variables
const { Robinhood } = stonks;
const robinhood = new Robinhood(username, password, deviceToken);
const order = await robinhood.buy('MSFT', {
  qty: 100,
  type: 'limit',
  price: 123.45,
});
```
