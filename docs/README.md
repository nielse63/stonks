## Features

- Custom screeners from finviz, msn, and finscreener
- Detailed ticket fundamentals
- Robinhood collection symbols
- And more features planned

### Goals

**What stonksjs is:**

The primary objective of this project are:

- To provide a collection of reliable algotrading utilities written in node
- Take some of the guess-work out of the stock research process by using
  industry-tested, predefined screeners
- Provide more data-points for a given instrument than other packages currently
  available
- Enable algotrading programmers with diversified assets - not just the hottest
  options rumors on [r/wallstreetbets](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets)

**What stonksjs is not:**

- stonksjs **is not** roboadvisor or professional trading app - this is just a
  fun little side project for me
- stonksjs **is not** an unofficial API for Robinhood or any other brokerage. If
  that's what you're looking for, I'd recommend
  [algotrader](https://github.com/torreyleonard/algotrader)
- stonksjs currently **is not** a backtesting tool, although that might get
  added to the roadmap soon

## Usage

Installation, usage, and API docs can be found in each scoped package directory.

## Development

### Setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone http://github.com/nielse63/stonksjs.git
cd stonksjs
npm ci
```

Because stonksjs is a monorepo using [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna),
a `postinstall` script will run `lerna bootstrap` to install all package
dependencies. Once this is complete you're ready to make your changes.

### Testing

Tests are run using `jest`, and can be run by executing:

```bash
npm test

# run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

The full test suite is also execute whenever a branch is pushed and as a
required pull request check.

### Release

To release a new version, run:

```bash
npm run release
```

This executes `lerna publish` behind the scenes, and you'll be prompted with a
few questions before the package is deployed.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to
discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Roadmap

All new features and changes are being tracked in GitHub under the
[projects](https://github.com/nielse63/stonksjs/projects) and
[issues](https://github.com/nielse63/stonksjs/issues) tabs of this repo.
